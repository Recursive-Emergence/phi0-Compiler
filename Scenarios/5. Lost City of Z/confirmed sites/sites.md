two sites found by lidar from the most recent paper with two larger settlments: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9177426/#Sec2

{"name": "Landívar", "lat": -15.2012842, "lon": -64.4677797},
{"name": "Cotoca", "lat": -14.9898697, "lon": -64.5968503},


Their lidar coverage is 100% and they are 20 km apart but both are small sites with no more than 2km in diameter. The most significant problem is the increased risk of false negatives – meaning, actual small sites might be missed because their signature isn't strong enough to alter the 5km cell's average characteristics significantly.
